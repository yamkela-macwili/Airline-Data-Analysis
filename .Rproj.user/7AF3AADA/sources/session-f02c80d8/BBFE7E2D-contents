## Airline on-time perfomance.
### Problem: Can we predict the likelihood of a flight delay?

## Load Required Libraries

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("Hmisc")
library("corrplot")
library(knitr)

```

## Load and Inspect the Dataset

### The dataset has 8000 rows and 109 columns.
```{r}
# Define the file path and read the dataset
file_path <- "C:/Users/yamke/Downloads/airline_2m/airline_2m.csv"
sub_airline <- read.csv(file_path, nrows = 8000)

# Display the structure of the dataset
glimpse(sub_airline)

```

## Dataset Glossary
### Now let's look at the features and description oh the dataset.
```{r}
url <- "C:/Users/yamke/OneDrive/Documents/Airline Analysis/Airline/table3.csv"
dataset_glossary <- read.csv( url)

# Print the dataset glossary in tabular format
kable(dataset_glossary)

```
### Variables of the Airline-Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance dataset include: 
####  - The target value "ArrDelay" or "ArrDelayMinutes".
#### - Reasons for delay (We will focus on the type of delay).

## Data Preprocessing

```{r}
# Count missing values in all columns
missing_values <- sub_airline %>% map(~sum(is.na(.)))
missing_values

```

#### Dealing with the missing values first.
#### N/A on our delay type means no delay, therefore we replace the missing values with 0.
```{r}
#Replace the missing values 
sub_airline <- sub_airline %>%
  mutate(across(contains("Delay"), ~replace(., is.na(.), 0)))

# Select and view the delay-related columns
delay_columns <- select(sub_airline, contains("Delay"))
kable(head(delay_columns))
```
#### Everything seems good, all the missing values are replaced with 0. Now we can visualize the data.

## Data Visualization
### Histogram of ArrDelay

```{r}

# Check the range 
range(sub_airline$ArrDelay)

# Create a histogram of ArrDelay
ggplot(data = sub_airline, mapping = aes(x = ArrDelay)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, color = "white", fill = "red") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(-60, 954))

```
#### The plot shows that, the count of flight which arrive on time is much greater than the flights that arrive early or the ones that arrive late. Thought it is visible that most flight arrive late, so our next question is, What causes a flight delay?

## Descriptive Statistics - Mean and Standard Deviation of ArrDelayMinutes

```{r}
count_airline <- sub_airline%>%
  count(sub_airline$Reporting_Airline)
kable(count_airline)

# Descriptive Statistics - Mean and Standard Deviation of ArrDelayMinutes
summary_airline_delay <- sub_airline %>%
  group_by(Reporting_Airline) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(ArrDelayMinutes), std_dev = sd(ArrDelayMinutes))
kable(summary_airline_delay)


# Create a simple average across Reporting_Airline and DayOfWeek
average_delays <- sub_airline %>% 
  group_by(Reporting_Airline, DayOfWeek)%>%
  summarise(mean_delays = mean(ArrDelayMinutes))
kable(head(average_delays))

#Sort the dataframe
arrange_avg_delay <- average_delays %>%
  arrange(desc(mean_delays))
kable(head(arrange_avg_delay))

# Visualize the data using Heatmap
average_delays %>%
  ggplot(aes( x = Reporting_Airline,
              y = DayOfWeek,
              fill = mean_delays))+
  geom_tile(color = "white", linewidth = 0.2)+
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "yellow",
                      high = "red")
     

```

## Linear Relationships
### Correlation Matrix Heatmap

```{r}
# Correlation between different delay types and ArrDelayMinutes
corr_airline <- sub_airline %>%
  select(ArrDelayMinutes, DepDelayMinutes, CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, LateAircraftDelay)

airline_correlation <- rcorr(as.matrix(corr_airline), type = "pearson")
correlation_matrix <- airline_correlation$r
kable(correlation_matrix, format = "markdown")

# Set the position of x-axis labels to the bottom (order = "hclust")
corrplot(correlation_matrix, method = "color", tl.col = "black", tl.srt = 45, addCoef.col = "black",
         tl.pos = "b", title = "Correlation Heatmap", order = "hclust")

```

## Model development 
### The question: Can we predict the arrival delay of a flight?

```{r}
mult_linear_reg <- lm(ArrDelay ~ DepDelayMinutes + CarrierDelay + WeatherDelay + NASDelay + SecurityDelay + LateAircraftDelay, data = sub_airline)
kable(summary(mult_linear_reg))

plot(mult_linear_reg)
```

## Conclusion
### This R Markdown document covers various aspects of airline data analysis, including data preprocessing, data visualization, and examining linear relationships through a correlation matrix heatmap.
